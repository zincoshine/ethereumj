## EthVM: EthereumJ

This is a forked version of [ethereumj](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj) client. 

Main differences to the original client are:

- It includes Kafka support that allows to store several important information needed for EthVM.
- It tweaks some parts of the code to fetch more blocks while syncing.
- More soon...

If you're searching for proper instructions on how to compile and use this client, then the better option is to visit the [official documentation](https://github.com/enKryptIO/ethereumj).
